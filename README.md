<h1 align="center">Credit-Risk-Classification</h1>

### For this assignment I was tasked with the analyis of loans using a machine learning model. I was tasked with predicting if a loan would be of low-risk or high-risk based on the financial data provided. The dataset included included various loan infoormation such as the amount, credit score and interest rate. The variable that I was tasked with using was the loan status. The analysis included processing the data, selecting the model, training the model, and evaluating it. The algorithm used for this analysis was logistic regression. 

# Results
- Accuracy: 99%
- Precision (Healthy Loan): 100%
- Precision (High-Risk): 84%
- Recall (Healthy Loan): 99%
- Recall (High-Risk): 94%

# Summary

### The regression model did pretty well having an accuracy of 99%. It showed high percentages for both precision and recall for both the Healthy Loan and High-Risk. The healthy loan predictions showed that all the low-risk loans in the dataset were actually low-risk by the accuracy scores. 

### I recommend using logistic regression for analyzing credit risk based on the above results. With these scores it is very useful for identifying low-risk and high-risk loans. This model seems to perfrom very well for analyzing credit risk from the high perrformance metrics.
